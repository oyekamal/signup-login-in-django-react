Briefly explain the purpose of each folder in your project.

## Backend Setup

1. **Virtual Environment (Optional):**

   - It's recommended to use a virtual environment for the Django backend to isolate dependencies. Create and activate a virtual environment:

     ```bash
     cd backend
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   - Install required Python packages using pip:

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Database Migration:**

   - Apply database migrations to set up the initial database schema:

     ```bash
     python manage.py migrate
     ```

4. **Run the Backend Server:**

   - Start the Django development server:

     ```bash
     python manage.py runserver
     ```

   The backend will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000/`.

## Frontend Setup

1. **Install Node Modules:**

   - Navigate to the frontend folder:

     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```

   - Install the required Node.js packages:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

2. **Run the Frontend Development Server:**

   - Start the React development server:

     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

   The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Running the Applications

1. **Concurrently (Recommended):**

   - Use a tool like `concurrently` to run both the backend and frontend simultaneously. Install it globally:

     ```bash
     npm install -g concurrently
     ```

   - Run the following command in the project root:

     ```bash
     concurrently "cd backend && python manage.py runserver" "cd frontend && npm start"
     ```

   The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000/` and the frontend at `http://localhost:3000/`.

2. **Separately:**
   - Run the backend and frontend servers in separate terminal windows.

Adjust the instructions based on your project's specifics, and include any additional setup steps or considerations your project may have.
